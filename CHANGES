1.11.3
- output missing FMEAN and SIGFMEAN when output DANO

1.11.2
- rationalise computation of means and sigmas from anomalous data
- use I/sigI derived data for F/sigI if it is given with anomalous flag

1.11.1
- correct anomalous measurebility plot and phil plot for anonalous input

1.11.0
- allow use of friedal pairs, without Imean

1.10.2
- use mean anisotropic eigenvalue when computing poorest resolution cuttoff

1.10.1
- fix issue of going out of range in moments plot

1.10.0
- use flat prior when request, or when have tNCS or twinning
- implementation is based on acentric case for Wilson prior

1.9.1
- correct Ice Rings statistic as we are working with merged data, unlike aimless

1.9.0
- introduce RNA/DNA reference curve

1.8.9
- bug fix to Optical Resolution routine

1.8.7, 1.8.8
- quick escape in case of failed anisotropy calculation

1.8.6
- update for gcc 4.7

1.8.5
- allow poorer data to be used

1.8.4
- use ML aniso values, corrected for Biso, to scale prior for truncate
- this should gain some of the speed back

 1.8.3
- use ML aniso values, corrected for Biso, to scale data for twinning tests

1.8.2
- restrict resolution range for aniso to tidy plots

1.8.1
- simplify WilsonB class and plotting to reduce confusion

1.8.0
- include completeness test for data quality.  Currently hardwired at I/sigI > 3
and above 85%
- more flexible Scattering class for calculation of the total scattering
- Completeness, tNCS, YorgoModis, ResoCorrel classes added for analysis

1.7.1
- make twinning test output more consistent

1.7
- use anisotopy in prior for truncate procedure
- no-aniso keyword now controls use of anisotropy in prior
- anisotropy corrected for twinning statistics, now not optional

1.6
- acentric tabulated data extended to h=10 to reduce discontinuity in plots
- Phil plot added to monitor output
