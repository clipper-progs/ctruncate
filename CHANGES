1.8.6
- update for gcc 4.7

1.8.5
- allow poorer data to be used

1.8.4
- use ML aniso values, corrected for Biso, to scale prior for truncate
- this should gain some of the speed back

 1.8.3
- use ML aniso values, corrected for Biso, to scale data for twinning tests

1.8.2
- restrict resolution range for aniso to tidy plots

1.8.1
- simplify WilsonB class and plotting to reduce confusion

1.8.0
- include completeness test for data quality.  Currently hardwired at I/sigI > 3
and above 85%
- more flexible Scattering class for calculation of the total scattering
- Completeness, tNCS, YorgoModis, ResoCorrel classes added for analysis

1.7.1
- make twinning test output more consistent

1.7
- use anisotopy in prior for truncate procedure
- no-aniso keyword now controls use of anisotropy in prior
- anisotropy corrected for twinning statistics, now not optional

1.6
- acentric tabulated data extended to h=10 to reduce discontinuity in plots
- Phil plot added to monitor output
